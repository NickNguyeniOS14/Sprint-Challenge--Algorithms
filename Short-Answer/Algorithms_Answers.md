#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear Time. O(n) because the output's value depend of the input size.

b) O(n^2) because we use two loops. So O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2). Quadratic Time 

c) Linear Time. O(n) because the output's value depend of the input size.
